# Network-Security-Homelab
Network security homelab that implements Pfsense and Suricata into my VM network

## Setup
The first part of this project is setting up the virtual machines I want to use. To simulate a small network, I used my own personal Kali Linux VM and I installed a separate Windows VM. Finally, to create the firewall, I downloaded an image of Pfsense which I will need to properly configure.
